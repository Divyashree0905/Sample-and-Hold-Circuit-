# Sample-and-Hold-Circuit-
Design of Sample and Hold circuit in LTspice
The sample-and-hold circuit, as its name implies, samples an input signal and holds on to its last sampled value until the input is sampled again. Figure 8–32 shows a sample-and-hold circuit using an op-amp with an E-MOSFET. In this circuit the E-MOSFET works as a switch that is controlled by the sample-and-hold control voltage

 , and the capacitor 
𝐶
C serves as a storage element. The circuit operates as follows. The analog signal

  is applied to the gate of the E-MOSFET. During the positive portion of 
𝑉

 , the E-MOSFET conducts and acts as a closed switch. This allows input voltage to charge capacitor 
𝐶
C. In other words input voltage appears across 
𝐶
C and in turn at the output, as shown in Figure 8–32(b). On the other hand, when 
𝑉
𝑆
V 
S
​
  is zero, the E-MOSFET is off (non-conductive) and acts as an open switch. The only discharge path for 
𝐶
C is, therefore, through the op-amp. However, the input resistance of the op-amp voltage follower is also very high; hence the voltage across 
𝐶
C is retained. The time periods

  of the sample-and-hold control voltage

  during which the voltage across the capacitor is equal to the input voltage are called sample periods. The time periods

​
  during which the voltage across the capacitor is constant are called hold periods [see Figure 8–32(b)]. The output of the op-amp is usually processed/observed during hold periods. To obtain close approximation of the input waveform, the frequency of the sample-and-hold control voltage must be significantly higher than that of the input. In critical applications a precision and/or high-speed op-amp is helpful. If possible, choose a low-leakage capacitor made of material such as Teflon or polyethylene.

A significant reduction in size and improved performance can be achieved by using a specially designed sample-and-hold IC such as the LF398. The functional circuit of the LF398 shown in Figure 8–33 requires only an external storage capacitor.

The sample-and-hold circuit is commonly used in digital interfacing and communications such as analog-to-digital and pulse modulation systems.
